# RoboPathFinder
Welcome to the Moving Robot repository! This project is an implementation of a moving robot's control system written in C. It serves as a base for creating a functional robot navigation system, but the code is currently incomplete and may contain bugs. The purpose of this project is to simulate and control a robot's movement using basic programming principles. It includes functionalities for:

-Controlling the robot's movement (forward, backward, left, right)

-Obstacle avoidance (planned but not fully implemented)

Features: 

-Language: C

-Current State: Work in Progress (WIP)

-Known Issues: The code is incomplete and may contain bugs, including unhandled edge cases and partial implementations of some features.

The primary objective of this repository is to:

-Provide a foundation for a robot movement system.

-Encourage collaboration to debug and enhance the system.

-Expand upon the existing code to include additional features like obstacle detection and efficient pathfinding.
